# drawer-1.1

### About

This is an implementation of a drawer application inspired by OOP. This is an improved application from the original source in my repository, named Capstone. If you compare this code with the original source code, you might find something powerful changed by OOP. More simply, you can open the uml.png file, and the opened uml diagram shows encapsulation, dynamic binding, inheritance, composition, dependency, and patterns.
